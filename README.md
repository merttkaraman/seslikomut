This project showcases a basic voice response bot built using Python. Inspired by virtual assistants like Siri, this bot utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries to interact with users through voice commands. While its functionalities are currently limited, it demonstrates the core concepts of building a voice-controlled interface.
